# osu!roomie

Quick website to compute points of an osu! room (or more precisely a large number of osu! rooms) quickly

## Things I think I'll never do

- Team VS
- Move API calls to the server
- Map pool system
- Default settings for new rooms
- Attain enlightenment

I'm too lazy and I don't have enough time to do this (especially enlightenment)
